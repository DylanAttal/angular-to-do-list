### Summary

This project was my first time using Angular! I followed along with a tutorial online by Brad Traversy at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdf5aTYRW0E. The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with how Angular works. Traversy began by explaining the basics of Angular to beginners, then we built a To Do List app step-by-step.

This was also my first time using TypeScript. I can see how static typing helps catch bugs even before running the code. Breaking the UI into components was familiar to me since I've had experience with React, but I found that Angular is different in a lot of ways. One way that stands out is that Angular seems to have a lot more packaged with it, like a router. Angular also comes with the HttpClient service; I had always imported a separate library into React to help with API calls. On that note, it seems like Angular separates duties of code more stringently than React. The idea of services was new to me; apparently in Angular, components shouldn't fetch or save data directly and instead should focus on presenting data and delegate data access to a service.
